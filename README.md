# Platformer Game Project (v1.0)

This is the very first version of a new platformer game being built in Pygame.

This initial release is focused on getting the core player controller and physics to feel right.

## Current Features

* **Basic Movement:** Full left/right movement.
* **Jumping:** Standard gravity and jumping.
* **Dashing:** Multi-charge dashing (air and ground).
* **Slam:** A fast-fall "ground slam" ability.
* **Slam-Jump Combo:** Chaining a slam into a jump grants a temporary height boost.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have `pygame` installed: `pip install pygame`
2. Run the main file: `python main.py`
