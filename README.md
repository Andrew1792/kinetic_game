# Platformer Game Project (v1.1)
This is early in code for the new platformer game being built in Pygame.
This initial release is focused on getting the core player controller, physics, levels, and collision to feel right.

## Current Features
* **Basic Movement:** Full left/right movement.
* **Jumping:** Standard gravity and jumping.
* **Dashing:** Multi-charge dashing (air and ground).
* **Slam:** A fast-fall "ground slam" ability.
* **Slam-Jump Combo:** Chaining a slam into a jump grants a temporary height boost.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have `pygame` installed: `pip install pygame`
2. Run the main file: `python main.py`
